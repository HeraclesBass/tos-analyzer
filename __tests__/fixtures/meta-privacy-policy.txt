Meta Privacy Policy

Effective Date: September 1, 2024

Meta Platforms, Inc. ("Meta," "we," "us," or "our") provides this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our products and services.

What is the Meta Privacy Policy and what does it cover?

We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That's why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use Meta Products in the way that's right for you.

In the Meta Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of the Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand.

What Products does this Policy cover?

This Policy covers the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide Meta Products. Meta Products, which we also call "Products," include:

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Messenger
- Products offered by Meta Platforms Technologies, such as Meta Horizon Worlds or Meta Quest
- Other Products that link to this Privacy Policy

What information do we collect?

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our Products. For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you even if you don't have an account.

Here's the information we collect:

We collect and receive information from and about the different devices you use and how you use them.

How do we use your information?

We use information we collect to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads, along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.

For some of these purposes, we use information across our Products and across your devices. The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use manual review to access and review your information.

To use less information that's connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information. We might also anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

To personalize our Products

We use information we have to provide and improve our Products. This includes personalizing features, content and recommendations, such as your Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed and Stories. We use information about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products, to personalize your experience.

We want to make sure our AI can understand, respond to and be useful for everyone in all the places where people use Meta Products. To do this, we use your information to train, test and improve our AI, subject to the choices and controls you have.

This can include information about you from across our Products and information we receive from our partners, such as the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.

Your content may be used to train our AI in certain circumstances. This includes public posts, comments, photos and videos across Facebook and Instagram.

If you share content through messages, we do not train our AI on that content except in certain safety and security circumstances.

You have the right to object to your information being used to improve our AI under applicable law. To object, you can use our form on the Facebook and Instagram Help Centers. If you object, we will stop using your information for this purpose going forward, but this won't affect any AI models that were trained before we received and processed your objection. You may have the right to request deletion of AI outputs that reference you by using the Help Centers.

How can you exercise your rights?

We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.

You also have the right to object to and restrict certain processing of your data. This includes the right to object to us processing your data for direct marketing, and the right to object to our processing of your data where we're performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party.

Data retention, account deactivation and deletion

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other's interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis.

When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted.
